I am an undergraduate student at the University of California Santa Barbara, majoring in Computer Science with a strong interdisciplinary interest in computer graphics. My primary academic interests lie in physically-based rendering, real-time graphics, and geometry. I am particularly fascinated by the intersection of numerical methods and visual realism—how mathematical models and algorithms can drive immersive, believable visual experiences.

I have independently studied foundational graphics courses such as [GAMES101](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~lingqi/teaching/games101.html) by Lingqi Yan and [CMU 15-462/662: Computer Graphics](https://15462.courses.cs.cmu.edu), through which I developed a solid understanding of the rendering pipeline, BRDFs, ray tracing, and geometric modeling. To deepen this knowledge, I have explored and reimplemented selected techniques from _Physically Based Rendering_ and _Real-Time Rendering_, and have studied the architecture of modern graphics engines like Unreal Engine—particularly its Nanite and Lumen systems.
